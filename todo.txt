Test error message for out-of-range exceptions.
    Use a "contains" rather than an "equals" condition.
    Refactor or remove exception message stuff. It's a bit of a mess.
    Why are exceptions thrown from an "unknown location"? What if I unwrap the throw?

Find a better way to do string comparisons in tests
(or use a different unit test library).

Add documentation on components:
    { 0 } { 1 2 } { 3 4 5 }

Send Boost performance test output to logfile.
Should be able to do this with a CTest command.

Make tests a compile option.

Do we need to test all connections in a component?

Should the test suites differ? It'd be nice to merge them....

Document quick_union to detail the tree structure that we're trying to use.

Figure out which Boost variables to set, if any.
Rather than resize() and generate(), try reserve() and then insert().
