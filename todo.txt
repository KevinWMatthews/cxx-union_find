Test error message for out-of-range exceptions.
    The underlying data structures throw for us so our tests can't actually tell if we're checking or not.
    I do want a more clear message - catch it in my class rather than in an underlying data structure.

Add documentation on components:
    { 0 } { 1 2 } { 3 4 5 }

Send Boost performance test output to logfile.
Should be able to do this with a CTest command.

Make tests a compile option.

Do we need to test all connections in a component?

Should the test suites differ?

Document quick_union to detail the tree structure that we're trying to use.

Figure out which Boost variables to set, if any.
Rather than resize() and generate(), try reserve() and then insert().
